                    <h1>What's Mingle Field?</h1>
                    <p>Our goal is to make meeting and making new friends easier. We beleive that going out and meeting
                        new
                        people
                        can be much more fun, and less stressful if you know that you're going to meet people <strong>just
                            like you.</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People who also want to meet you, not just the other way around.</li>
                        <li>People who have the same interest as you, and...</li>
                        <li>People who are of similar age.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        On top of that, we want to provide our users with <strong>special discounts</strong> at the
                        places
                        they're
                        going to
                        meet.
                        Maybe you're going to go out anyway, then why not go to a place that's provided in our system
                        and
                        <strong>spend less money?</strong></p>
